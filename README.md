# For - Else
• The else function after the for function takes precedence over search adventures - to provide a program exit when the search is not specified
# Break

# While

# While - For

# List Comprehension (Create a list with In Line Loops and If)
• There are times when we need to create a new list from the previous list operation.

• List comprehension is a way to generate new content based on previously existing lists or irretables.

• The underscore includes valid variable equations.

• In general "_" is usually used as a throwaway variable (unimportant variable).
# Function (Definition, Calling, and Return Function)
Function

• In mathematics, a function is a process that relates between an input and an output.

• In Python, apart from these relational functions, functions are also a way to organize code - with the ultimate goal of code being reusable.

• It is best if functions have only one specific use but can be reused.

• Common functions are provided by Python. But we can define our own functions.

Defining functions

• Functions are defined with the def keyword followed by the function name and parameters in brackets ()

• Optionally, you can add a docstring - a documentation string that describes the context of the function.

• The code block in each function begins with a colon and uses indentation.

• The function stops when there is a return [expression] statement which returns [expression] to the caller.

• You can also make a function not return output with return None.

• By default, Python will position each parameter according to the order in which they were registered when they were defined, and must be called in that order.

• The return (expression) statement will make the program execution exit the current function, while returning a certain value.

• The return value of a function can be stored in a variable.

• This will differentiate a function that returns a value from a function that does not return a value (filter is called a procedure).
